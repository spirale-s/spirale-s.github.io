		<div>Theoretically there are no borders between different art practices in a digital environment. Art itself has become 'universal' and because of this it almost looses its meaning. In a networked environment hybrid cultural practices are not rare, but common. Music meets the visual arts, performance meets radio art, dance meets poetry, design meets film and mail art meets performance, all within the realm of what used to be called media art. A work of art occupies a different kind of space now. Not so much because of digitization, but because of the network, which connects all singular digital and other worlds.

The reality of art in a networked society is somewhat different from the 'ideal' of universal artistry though. The coming of the Internet, and especially the development of the worldwide web, has created a very new situation for the art world, even if the majority of those represented in it still have no clue about it. In cyberspace art institutions have the opportunity to present themselves and their work on an equal level with not only individuals and independent art initiatives, but also with big media players. For the first time art institutions have their own media channel. This is very important to realize. It is important for various reasons, the most intriguing one for me being the fact that through becoming a media player art institutions suddenly have entered the realm of media politics and social and cultural responsibility.</div>
